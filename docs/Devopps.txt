  Description :- Desired State Management 
  
   It has One Kubernates Cluster Services and having different workers 
   It has different components sits here and run in different workers example API component .
   
   What is worker ? 
   
   Worker is just a container host in kubernates enviroment . 
   
   all workers communicate through Kubernates Cluster Services .
   
   
   What is POD ? 
   
   Ans) Its a smallest unit in deployment in kubernates. 
   
   app.yml in Kubernates Cluster Services ??? 
   
   ans ) yes its in api component . 
   
   PODS having container images may be 2 .
   
app.yml 

deployment 

pod 1 ---> container img 1 
           container img 2 
		   
		   replica -> 3 
pod 2 ---> 	 container img 3 
             replica -2

           Docker Installation :- https://runnable.com/docker/install-docker-on-linux
 
           The contents of /var/lib/docker/, including images, containers, volumes, and networks, are preserved. The Docker Engine - Community package is now called docker-ce.
           
		 Install Docker in centos  :- sudo yum install docker-ce-18.09.1 docker-ce-cli-18.09.1 containerd.io
		 Install Docker in ubuntu  :-
		 https://www.tutorialspoint.com/docker/installing_docker_on_linux.htm

		 
		 Start Docker :- sudo systemctl start docker
		 
		 Verify that Docker Engine - Community is installed correctly by running the hello-world image.

       Verify Docker Image :- $ sudo docker run hello-world

		 ubuntu 
		 
		 sudo apt-get update

Options
sudo − The sudo command is used to ensure that the command runs with root access.

update − The update option is used ensure that all packages are updated on the Linux system.

The next step is to install the necessary certificates that will be required to work with the Docker site later on to download the necessary Docker packages. It can be done with the following command.

sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https ca-certificates

		 Add New GPG Key 
		 
		 command :- sudo apt-get install docker-ce=<5:18.09.1~3-0~ubuntu-xenial> docker-ce-cli=<5:18.09.1~3-0~ubuntu-xenial> containerd.io

                How to Create VPC and whats the use of it ??? 
				
				       Virtual Private Cloud  it gives separate network meaning its like intranet (Oranization limited)
					   
					   1) Create VPC 
					   2) Create Internet gateway --> Meaning it connects our created vpc to outside world (Internet) 
					   3) Attach our VPC to this Internet gateway.
					   4) Create Subnet 
					   5) create Route Tables --when create vpc it is create route table by default .
					   6) edit route to connect internet gateway 
					   7) edit subnet associations by our created subnet 
					   8) Create Security groups for our created VPC 
					   9) Edit Newtwork ACL with Security Groups and its inbound and outbound rules 
					   (Need to learn more on VPC these concepts) 
					   
					   Testing Purpose :- 
					   
					    create one EC2 with this VPC ..
						
						
						Windows for Kubernates

					Dokcer in ubuntu 
					
					1) docker search ubuntu ---> it will list all the ubuntu docker images 
					
					2) docker pull ubuntu --->  it will pull or download the ubuntu docker image or container .
					
					  ex:- docker pull java ---> it will pull java docker image 
					3) docker run ubuntu ---> to run ubuntu docker image 
					
					4) docker images ---> it will list all the docker images which are running .
					
					5)  docker run -it java ----> To Login Docker image "java" container 
					
					6) whats the main purpose of Docker ? Very Important ..
					
					7) docker image build -t employee-prodcuer .(current directory)
					
					8) docker container run --name producer -p 8080:8080 -d employee-prodcuer 
					
					9) docker container logs producer 
					
					10) docker container exec -it producer /bin/sh --> Login to container than run here for rest response 
					
					11) curl -I localhost:8080/employee (Inside container)
										
					18.224.39.136:8080/employee 
					
					12) docker container stop producer ---> To stop docker container 
					
					13) docker container rm producer ---> To remove docker container
					
					14) docker network ls ---> list docker networks
					
					15) docker network create networkName

                Install Curl Command :- 

                 Installing cURL for Ubuntu Linux
The procedure to install cURL on Ubuntu Linux is as follows:

Update your Ubuntu box, run: sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
Next, install cURL, execute: sudo apt install curl
Verify install of curl on Ubuntu by running: curl --version
Let us see all commands in details.

Ubuntu install curl command
First update the system and get latest stable curl version for Ubuntu:
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt upgrade

Type the following apt command or apt-get command:
$ sudo apt install curl 

Verification
Run the following command:
$ curl --version 

Usage
Once installed you can use it as follows to see the headers:
$ curl -I https://www.google.co.in/
$ curl -I https://www.cyberciti.biz/ 
 curl -I localhost:8080/employee 

Or download a file from a server using curl itself:
curl -o output.file http://server1.cyberciti.biz/bar.foo.txt

You can resume broken download with the curl command as follows:
curl -L -O -C - http://ftp.ussg.iu.edu/linux/centos/latest/isos/file.iso

		   4) Docker Containers for all microservies  --- sanjay or ram Reference distillery 
		   
		       1) docker network tracrat 
			   2) set of docker commands will stop existing container , remove container than create new container for every build with
			   existing docker network called tracrat and run containers (run jars) 
			   3) Test from gotracrat.in ----> 
			   
		    5) Push docker images to own registery and pull from docker repo  (distillary or tracrat) - ram 

                Sample -- poc --
				
		    6)  Good hands on writing pipeline scripts which does - sanjay and ram 
			
			 below steps 
			 
			  1) take code from git 
			  
			  2) compile 
			  
			  3)  artificats management 
			  
			  4) connnect SSH to ubuntu server 
			  
			  5) run docker containers and deploy 
			  
			  6) sonar code review comments 
			  
			  
			 7) AWS enviroment  - sanjay and ram 


                 We should use new network for tracrat ..
				 
		     8) Hands on experience on shell scripting ..   sanjay and ram  and rajesh 
			 
			 
			 9) Developt a  terraform script for ubuntu our tracrat enviroment -- sanjay and ram  and rajesh 
			 
			 10) Users and role management in aws account and jenkins  -- sanjay and ram 
			 
			  for ex :-  create 4 users 
			    1) sanjay 2) mani 3) ram 4) sireesha 5) admin 
				
				   2) and 3) having distillary 2 jobs access remaining people when they login they should not see 
				   
				   for 4) she can only run jobs of tracrat and distillary but she cannot access configure and other modules ..
				   
		     11) able to write some shell scripts by our own to automate some clean up and effectively use post build actions of
			  all jenkins jobs wisely to clean up space .. -- sanjay and ram

 why Terraform is important in devops ? 
 
 There are a bunch of reasons for giving preference to Terraform to be used as one of the significant tools of DevOps.
 The main motive of DevOps is to bring efficiency and quality in software delivery. 
 For this, some tools are required for making the delivery smoother, faster and efficient.
 Here, terraform comes to the limelight where it aids organizations in automating and also aids with infrastructure as code.
 Terraform is helpful with its availability of implementing every type of coding principle.
 The extraordinary feature of terraforming includes its quickness and the operations performed by it. 
 These are some of the important reasons for which Terraform is gaining popularity and attention in the organizations.
